src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PostsForm/PostForm.jsx        # Component for adding posts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PostsList/PostList.jsx        # Component for displaying posts
â”œâ”€â”€ redux/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ posts/postsSlice.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ store.js            # Redux store configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx                 # Main app component
â”œâ”€â”€ index.jsx               # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ index.css               # Global styles
